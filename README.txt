Welcome to Queued!

The /src directory contains all of the code necessary to build Queued, the 
Adobe AIR application designed to let you manage your Netflix account from
a desktop application.

We are going to assume that you have installed the Adobe AIR SDK somewhere
(version 1.5 or better), and that you've added the /bin folder to your
PATH variables so that you can run a debugging version locally for development.

To test out Queued, open up a terminal or command line, nav to your checkout, and
type:

adl src/Queued.xml

We also included a sample build shell script; you will need to alter this in order
to sign the application correctly with your own certificate.

Happy Queueing!
